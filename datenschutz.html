          <h2>General use of the website</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Access data</h3>
          <p>We collect information about you when you use this website. We automatically collect information about your
            usage
            pattern and your interaction with us and register data about your computer or mobile device. We collect,
            store and use
            data about every access to our online offer (so-called server log files). The access data includes the name
            and URL of
            the accessed file, date and time of access, transferred data volume, notification of successful access (HTTP
            response
            code), browser type and browser version, operating system, referrer URL (i.e. the previously visited page),
            IP address
            and the requesting provider.</p>
          <p>We use this protocol data without allocation to your person or other profile creation for statistical
            evaluations for
            the purpose of operation, security and optimization of our online offer, but also for anonymous recording of
            the number
            of visitors to our website (traffic) as well as the extent and type of use of our website and services, as
            well as for
            accounting purposes to measure the number of clicks received from cooperation partners. Based on this
            information, we
            can provide personalized and location-based content and analyze traffic, troubleshoot and correct errors and
            improve our
            services. We reserve the right to subsequently check the log data if there is a justified suspicion of
            illegal use based
            on concrete evidence. We store IP addresses in the log files for a limited period of time if this is
            necessary for
            security purposes or if it is necessary for the provision of services or the invoicing of a service, e.g. if
            you use one
            of our offers. After cancellation of the order process or after receipt of payment, we delete the IP address
            if it is no
            longer required for security purposes. We also save IP addresses if we have concrete suspicion of a criminal
            offence in
            connection with the use of our website. We also save the date of your last visit (e.g. when registering,
            logging in,
            clicking on links etc.) as part of your account.</p>
          <h2>E-mail contact</h2>
          <p>If you contact us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail), we will save your details for the purpose of
            processing the enquiry
            and in the event that follow-up questions arise. We only store and use other personal data if you give your
            consent or
            if this is legally permissible without special consent.</p>
